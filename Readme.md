# Rounds Continue
A simple mod that replaces the _Rematch ?_ Popup at the end of the Match with a _Continue ?_ Prompt, and lets you continue the Match instead of rematching...

### Why?
Simple: All other mods that added  the continue function which I have found, are either locked to the modded (older) version of ROUNDS or have been deprecated / discontiued

**Compatible with the newest Version of ROUNDS (even without changing the beta to modded)**
